# Network-Port-Scan
Cyber Security Internship - Task 1: Network Port Scanning

üîç Local Network Port Scanning with Nmap
üìã Objective
This project demonstrates how to scan your local network to identify active devices, open ports, and potential security risks using Nmap and optional Wireshark analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Perform
1. Find Your Local Network Range
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux/macOS).

Run: ifconfig OR ipaddr
Note your IPv4 Address and Subnet Mask.
Calculate your network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

2. Run TCP SYN Scan with Nmap
Open Terminal/Command Prompt with admin privileges.

Run the following command: nmap -sS <your_network_range>
Example: nmap -sS 192.168.142.128/24


3. Note Down Discovered Hosts and Open Ports
Review the Nmap output.

Document: IP addresses of active devices.
Open ports and their associated services.

4. Optional: Analyze Traffic with Wireshark
Open Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface.
Start capturing packets before running Nmap.
Apply filter to view SYN packets: tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==0


5. Research Common Services on Open Ports
Identify what services run on discovered ports.
Examples:
  | Port | Service | Description          |
  |------|---------|----------------------|
  | 22   | SSH     | Remote Shell         |
  | 80   | HTTP    | Web Server           |
  | 443  | HTTPS   | Secure Web Server    |
  | 445  | SMB     | Windows File Sharing |
  | 3389 | RDP     | Remote Desktop       |

6. Identify Potential Security Risks
Unnecessary open ports can be exploited.
Examples of risks:
SSH (22):Brute-force attacks.
Web Ports (80/443):Vulnerable applications.
SMB (445):EternalBlue/SMB exploits.
RDP (3389):Unauthorized remote access.

üìöRequirements
 1. Nmap  
 2. Wireshark (optional)  

‚úÖ **Conclusion
Local network scanning helps identify vulnerabilities, providing an opportunity to strengthen network security before attackers exploit weaknesses.
